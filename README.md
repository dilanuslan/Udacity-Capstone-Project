# Sparkify: Predicting Churn for a Music Streaming Service


## Requirements
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- PySpark

## The Motivation For The Project
This project aims to predict churn based on user activities in a music app called Sparkify The definition of churn is to quit getting services from a service provider. The goal of predicting churn is to decrease the number of churners with some offers in order to save revenue. This workspace contains a tiny subset (128MB) of the total dataset (12GB). Exploratory Data Analysis, feature engineering, implementing ML Classification algorithms, fine-tuning, and evaluation were the steps of the project. 


## File Descriptions

There is a Jupyter notebook (Sparkify.ipynb) to store and show the work that has been done for the project. 


## Summary of the Results

The details of the project can be found on my [Medium Blog post](www.medium.com) Logistic Regression algorithm had the best performance with 83% F1-score and 85% accuracy.
